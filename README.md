# e-commerce-back-end

## Description

The objective of this project was to create the back end of an e-commerce site using sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. The database contains information about the products available and how they are organized. The front-end was not built out, so Insomnia was used to show the GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE method routes functioning.

## Usage

In order to use this program you first need to run the database file using MySQL to create the database. From there you can populate the database by running the seed file by entering the "npm run seed" command in the terminal. After the database is populated, a program like Insomnia can be used to demonstrate the GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE method routes.
